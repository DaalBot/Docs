## Auto Roles
Auto roles are roles that are automatically assigned to a user when they join the server. This can be used to give users a role that identifies them as a member of the server, or to give them a role that allows them to access certain channels. For info on how to setup auto roles please see the [Auto Roles](/docs/commands/autorole) page.

## Self Roles
Self roles are roles that users can assign to themselves. This can be used to give users access to certain channels, or to identify themselves as a member of a certain group. For info on how to setup self roles please see the [Self Roles](/docs/commands/selfrole) page.

## Linked Roles [Coming Soon]
Linked roles automatically grant a role when a user has another role. This can be used to create stuff such as role categories like `-----[Staff]-----` when gaining a staff role. For info on how to setup linked roles please see the [Linked Roles](#) page.
