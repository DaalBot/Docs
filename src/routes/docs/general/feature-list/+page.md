> This page may be incomplete, we are still working on our documentation. If you have any questions, please join our [support server](https://go.daalbot.xyz/HQ).

## 🎫 Ticket System
- **Support Request Management**: You can easily set up and manage a ticket system to allow members to ask for assistance or report issues.
- **Limitless Ticket Panels**: Customizable ticket creation panels with "Basic" (Guided) and "Advanced" (JSON) modes.
- **Discord Chat Replication**: We will replicate the Discord chat experience in your transcripts so although the channel is deleted, you can still read the conversation as if it was in Discord.
> Discord chat replication is actually a feature from [TicketsBot](https://ticketsbot.net/); unfortunately, it's been discontinued but we still use their [discord-chat-replica](https://github.com/TicketsBot/discord-chat-replica) fork to provide this feature.

## 👋 Auto-Role & Self-Roles
- **Auto-Role Assignment**: Automatically assign roles to new members as they join.
- **Self-Roles**: Let users pick their own roles through interactive menus.

## 🛡️ Moderation Tools
- **Logging**: Track events like channel creation/deletion, bans, member joins/leaves, role changes, and more.
- **Warnings System**: Issue and log warnings to members.

## 💾 Data & Privacy
- **Data Commands**: Access and manage data relating to your server.
- **Automated Data Deletion**: We automatically delete data after 30 days of being removed from a server.

## 🏅 Leveling & XP
- **XP System**: Reward member activity with experience points and leveling.
- **Leaderboard**: From the dashboard, you can view the top members based on their XP.

## 🧑‍💻 Events & Custom Functionality
Events are a powerful feature that allows you to create custom logic to run in your server whenever a specific gateway event occurs. You can use raw JavaScript to create these events or soon enough our visual editor will allow you to create events without writing any code.

## 🪄 Utilities & Hex
[Hex](https://hex.daalbot.xyz) is a discord tool site that allows you do things such as:
- [**Components V2 Support**](https://hex.daalbot.xyz/components): Easily create and send Components V2 messages.

## 🔗 Invite tracking
- **Invite Tracking**: Keep track of who used what invite link to join your server.
- **Role Invites**: Assign roles to users depending on which invite link they used to join.

## 💻 Open API
Our API is designed to be as open and accessible as possible, whether you want to build your own bot to integrate with DaalBot or use the API for other purposes. You can find the API documentation [here](/docs/api).
