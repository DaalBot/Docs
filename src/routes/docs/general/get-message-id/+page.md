# Getting Message IDs
Message IDs are unique identifiers for messages in the chat. They are used to identify messages in the chat, while most places where you can put in a message ID will also accept a message link, it is still useful to know how to get a message ID.

## Method 1: Candy
Add the app to your account using the following link: [Add Candy](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1270311327767855137&integration_type=1&scope=applications.commands) then use the the `Details` button in `Apps >` to get the message ID and some other useful information.

## Method 2: Developer Mode
1. Open Discord and go to the settings.
2. Go to the `Advanced` tab under `App settings`
3. Turn on `Developer Mode`
4. Right-click / Long tap on the message you want to get the ID of and click `Copy ID`

## Method 3: Message Link
1. A:  Right-click / Long tap on the message you want to get the ID of and click `Copy Message Link` the last part of the link is the message ID. (Example: `https://discord.com/channels/123456789012345678/123456789012345678/987654321098765432` the message ID is `987654321098765432`)
2. B: If you have a message link, DaalBot should be able to extract the message ID from it automatically.
